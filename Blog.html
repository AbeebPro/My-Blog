	<h2>Is HTML a programming language?</h2>
	<p>Well that's a question I've found most beginners in web development asking.Html is not a programming language but a mark-up language every web developer should know. It is a language that gives structure to whatever website/webapps you want to build. With consistent practice, it's a very simple language you can learn in little or no time. There are many concepts in HTML but you don't have to try memorizing them all. It's a language that evolves every now and then. Perhaps, you've heard of HTML4? Probably. The most recent version of html right now is HTML5 with really interesting new concepts. 
	<h2>Need Help?</h2>
	<p>HTML, generally, has a wide array of elements and attributes, so if you find yourself needing help, you can visit sites like <a href="www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a>, or <a href="developer.mozilla.org">MDN</a>. Those are the top two sites with resources and documentation on HTML and many programming languages you'll be needing in your web development journey.</p>

	<h2>Class Review</h2>
	<p>ScholarNurture web development bootcamp has been a really helpful one. I've been introduced to new stuff in web development, HTML and CSS, both in theory and practical. I really hope we end up becoming the skillful web developers they want us to be. The resources and online sessions/classes have been helpful so far and we've been able to meet some experienced trainers.
